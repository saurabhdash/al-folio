I am a PhD student in [Electrical and Computer Engineering](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/){:target="\_blank"} at [GeorgiaTech](https://www.gatech.edu/){:target="\_blank"}, advised by [Prof. Saibal Mukhopadhyay](https://www.ece.gatech.edu/faculty-staff-directory/saibal-mukhopadhyay){:target="\_blank"}. 

My interests lie in building intelligent systems which can also compete with the energy efficiency of the human brain. I am currently looking into learning in event-based dynamical systems. Last year, I worked on robust Deep Learning algorithms in unreliable NVM device (ReRAM, FeFET) based hardware (to appear in proceedings ICCAD 2020), dynamical systems and Spiking Neural Networks.

I was awarded the ECE fellowship at GeorgiaTech during my admission into the PhD program. During my undergraduate studies at [IIT Kharagpur](https://www.iitkgp.ac.in/){:target="\_blank"}, I received the Order of Merit for distinguished performance in the field of technology. My undergraduate thesis was also nominated for the Best Thesis Award. Apart from my academics and personal research projects, I have helped inculcate a thriving research culture at IIT Kharagpur and share my passion for technology through the [Kharagpur RoboSoccer Students’ Group](https://www.krssg.in/){:target="\_blank"} – a diverse mix of freshman to senior undergraduate students from various departments working together to build robots that play soccer autonomously. As the head of the group, I was fortunate to lead the first ever Indian contingent to qualify for RoboCup SSL to Japan.

I spent the summers of 2018 at [Texas Instruments](http://www.ti.com/){:target="\_blank"}, India working on high speed A-to-D converters where I proposed jitter estimation and compensation algorithms to improve the narrow-band spurious-free dynamic range (SFDR).

I also received the NTU India-Connect Scholarship that enabled me to visit [Prof. Arindam Basu's](http://research.ntu.edu.sg/expertise/academicprofile/pages/StaffProfile.aspx?ST_EMAILID=ARINDAM.BASU){:target="\_blank"} lab at [Nanyang Technological University](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/){:target="\_blank"}, Singapore as a visiting summer researcher where I worked on low resolution synapses for Neuromorphic classifiers to mitigate the degradation in classification accuracy in Neuromorphic classifiers due to device mismatch.
